## What is a Markov Chain? 

At its core, a Markov chain is a mathematical concept that describes a sequence of events, where the probability of transitioning from one event to another is solely dependent on the current state. In simpler terms, it is a process that moves from one state to another, with the next state determined only by the current configuration.

## The Markov Property

The defining characteristic of a Markov chain is the Markov property. This property states that the probability of transitioning to a certain state depends only on the current state and not on any preceding events. To put it simply, the future is independent of the past given the present.

To illustrate this property, let's consider an example. Suppose we have a weather forecasting model that predicts three states: sunny, cloudy, and rainy. If we apply the Markov property, the probability of transitioning from cloudy to rainy depends only on the fact that it is currently cloudy and not on any previous weather conditions or events.

## The Transition Matrix

To capture the probabilities of transitioning from one state to another, a Markov chain utilizes a transition matrix. This matrix, often denoted by (P), provides a clear representation of the system's dynamics. Each entry (P_{ij}) in the matrix represents the probability of transitioning from state (i) to state (j) in a single step.

Let's consider a simple example to solidify this concept further. Imagine we have a system that models the weather in a particular city with two states: rainy and sunny. The probability of transitioning from rainy to rainy can be denoted as (P_{rr}), while the probability of transitioning from sunny to rainy will be (P_{sr}).
